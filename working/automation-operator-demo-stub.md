# Automation Operator Kit — Demo Stub

## Objective
Give visitors a quick, tangible sense of Mission Control as a product. The stub should showcase the alert-triage workflow, highlight how the kit delivers prompts/config/docs, and guide visitors toward the pilot or onboarding sequence.

## Sections
1. **Hero + positioning**
   - Headline: *"Mission Control in a box"*
   - Subhead: *"Deploy a hardened automation operator workflow—alert triage, remediation, and reporting—in under 15 minutes."*
   - CTA button: *"Pilot the kit"* (links to form/Email / Stripe)
   - Visual: Mission Control dashboard mock screenshot (placeholder) + badge list of benefits (speed, governance, automation).

2. **How it works (3 columns)**
   - Observe → triage → act → report workflow summary with quick bullets.
   - Include sample JSON payload, sample prompt excerpt, and a highlight about safety checks.

3. **Kit contents**
   - Cards for Prompts, Config, Docs, Delivery + Mission Control demo.
   - Each card includes 2–3 bullet points and optionally a "peek" link to download sample.

4. **Pilot proof**
   - Mission Control lab section: short log excerpt or metric ("<5m to triage + 100% accuracy on today’s alert"), plus quote from our internal team.

5. **Delivery + pricing**
   - Outline: instant download + onboarding call options.
   - Mention pilot price or invite contact for custom tier.
   - CTA: *"Launch Mission Control Kit"* with button linking to email/form/Stripe stub.

6. **Next steps / trust**
   - Testimonials / logos / relevant metrics.
   - Short FAQ ("What do I need to deploy?" "How do updates work?").

## Implementation notes
- Build this in Notion/Framer/Markdown page.
- Add a simple form (Notion form or Typeform embed) to capture pilot interest and sync with onboarding automation.
- Use placeholder visuals initially; replace with Mission Control screenshots after pilot.
- Link the CTA to the automated delivery flow once payment/form is ready.
