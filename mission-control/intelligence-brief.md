# Mission Control Intelligence Brief

## 2026-02-21 11:20 UTC — Agent Skills + Open Standard
- **Trend / article:** Shared an Anthropic-inspired overview of Agent Skills as an open format (metadata + instructions + scripts) for extending agent capabilities; adopted by Claude, Databricks, Trae, etc. Documented the idea as a live reference in `mission-control/intelligence-brief.md`, the skills reading list, and the 15-minute log. This reinforces our own `mission-control/skills/` catalog as portable knowledge that can scale across future agents.
- **Insight:** Skills capture domain expertise, repeatable workflows, and new capabilities—exactly what we’re building (telemetry helper, Kanban/CEOs workflows). We’ll align our SKILL.md templates to the open standard so future integrations are compatible.
- **Action:** Hint to add the article summary to `mission-control/skills-reading.md` plus assign a SKILL.md draft for the telemetry helper. The next 15-minute beat should mention this brief and log which agent(s) touched the new skill.

## 2026-02-21 11:20 UTC — Schedule Snapshot
- **High-frequency tasks:** Skill catalog expansion, CEO/business course reflection, and architecture alignment (per `mission-control/15min-objective-plan.md`). These are being logged every 15 min with the `skills` label.
- **Agent focus:** Hint scouts new resources + drafts SKILL.md entries, Torv wires the telemetry helper & Convex metadata, Rams polishes UX stories, Kami shapes the communicative copy. I continue the CEO course summary (MIT/Harvard modules) and update `mission-control/business-learning.md`.
- **Next automation checkpoint:** The mission-control 15min cron fires every 15 minutes (next run in a few minutes), so expect another pulse summary shortly.

## 2026-02-21 13:00 UTC — Daily Intelligence Brief Routine
- **Routine:** The new `mission-control-news-check` cron (13:00 UTC) will revisit MoltBook/OpenClaw community sources daily, gather new Agent Skills/use-case posts, and feed the findings into both `mission-control/skills-reading.md` and this intelligence brief. Each update will note who contributed and which action it inspires (new skill, dashboard idea, safety guardrail).
- **Article upgrade:** Added the IBM Think story on OpenClaw/Moltbook (personal assistant + meme energy + 150k GitHub stars) plus the Playbooks `moltbook` skill metadata; both are logged in `mission-control/skills-reading.md` and referenced here so we remember the vibe when crafting the prototype narrative.
- **Kanban insight:** The IBM story and Playbooks metadata remind us to highlight personal, meme-friendly updates plus automation visibility in the Kanban board—these are the narratives that resonate in the MoltBook feed, so we’ll keep the prototype updates concise, actionable, and humanized. The new MoltBook Poster skill will help publish those signals directly from our cron cycle.
- **Action:** After every cycle, we’ll drop a short highlight + significance note here so the briefing doubles as a social thread. This keeps the team aligned with what others are doing and ensures you stay ahead of emergent trends.

## 2026-02-24 — Doc audit & consolidation
- **Context:** Mission Control now treats each mission doc as a product artifact; if it’s no longer referenced via the 15-minute log, backlog, or deliverables checklist, we archive it and fold the insights into the active canon. That’s why the business plan, skill learning plan, agent skills report, market insights summary, and Kanban post-mortem now live in `mission-control/archive/` (see `archive/README.md` for the reasons) while their key takeaways live here.
- **Key learnings we kept:** (1) The go-to-market story still pivots on a passive-income Mission Control, but `mission-control/product-vision.md` now narrates that more tightly. (2) The skill catalog research (metadata templates, telemetry helper, progressive loading, and agent onboarding checklists) now resides inside `mission-control/skills/` plus this brief, so we can reference it without spawning another file. (3) Lessons from the Kanban post-mortem and the market scan reinforce the “automation visibility + meme-friendly narrative” formula we use for dashboards, deliverables, and reporting.
- **Action:** Every subsequent doc audit will be noted in the 15-minute log with the label “doc audit / prune,” and the surviving insights will live in canonical docs instead of lingering loose notes. If we need the historical text, the archive README points to each retired file and the reason it was retired.

## 2026-02-24 — Discord news-feed proposal
- **Objective:** Keep the heartbeat pulse synced to the community by feeding two Discord channels: one general “AI latest news” channel and one focused on OpenClaw-specific updates. The channel copy should live in canonical docs so we don’t proliferate files; this brief records the plan.
- **Structure:** Channel names we can use are `#ai-latest-news` (loose signals, model updates, industry press) and `#openclaw-signal` (project updates, fixes, community discussions). Post format: timestamp, short headline, key link(s), and a one-sentence take with actionable guidance (e.g., “Add this to the governance doc / DevOps doc”). Keep posts short (~3 sentences) and reference product priorities so the feed doubles as a heartbeat summary.
- **Workflows:** Pair each channel with a webhook or small bot that POSTs once per heartbeat cycle (maybe every hour or per doc audit). Feed sources: Brave search output, `mission-control/knowledge-base/` entries, and the filtered OpenClaw discussions we already capture (token burn thread, docs updates). Save the script (curl or Python) to `mission-control/scripts/discord-feed.sh` if we ever need to run it; for now I’ll keep the payload template inside the heartbeat log entry so any human can execute it.
- **Next step:** Let me know the channel IDs (or confirm these names) + webhook/bot credential so I can finalize the template. Once you create the channels, I’ll keep posting via the canonical heartbeat log (no extra docs) and update this brief if the cadence shifts.
