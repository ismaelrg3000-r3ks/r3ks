# Mission Control Business Plan

## 1. Vision
**Passive-income business** where Mission Control itself is the product: an autonomous, multi-agent orchestration house that runs 24/7. We widen the bottleneck by designing a system that needs minimal human direction—agents just vibe-code with natural language, execute workflows, and keep the mission moving.

## 2. Problem
- Building autonomous teams is hard because people (even us) don’t yet know how to configure, coordinate, and trust agents without constant nudges.
- Coordination knowledge is scattered across Convex rows, docs, and cron reminders, making it tough to give consistent guidance to new agent teams.
- The feedback loop from shared state (Convex) to agent action is still emerging; we need a repeatable system that makes agents sync and act without a human watching every move.

## 3. Solution
- Ship Mission Control as a turn-key orchestration product: canonical docs (SOUL, WORKING, Mission Control cadence), Convex templates, and curated crons that reinforce event-driven flow.
- Package the knowledge graph for agent coordination (Convex, mission docs, pulsing logs) so teams can onboard faster and achieve autonomous operation by editing natural-language cues.
- Provide a consulting/enablement layer that helps organizations define their mission, write matching crons, and tune convextable flows.

## 4. Market/Customer
- Small teams wanting to automate dev/ops work without hiring full-time engineers
- Automation-first product studios that need reliable orchestration across multiple autonomous agents
- Technical founders who want a living operations brain that covers 24/7 monitoring and execution

## 5. Go-to-Market
- Offer a pilot package: mission-control setup + 1-week tuning, delivered via workspace docs and cron templates.
- Capture case studies from our rollout—document how the cron adjustments and Convex alignment drove outcomes.
- Build passive income via templated mission suites, subscription access to tuned cron libraries, or a hosted “Agent Orchestrator” powered by Mission Control.

## 6. Metrics & Signals
- Number of teams using Mission Control cadence docs
- Frequency of Convex `ready` rows moving to `done` without human prompts
- Cron effectiveness (did the signal-customized reminders reduce noise?)

## 7. Next Steps
1. Codify this plan in Convex or mission files so Mission Control stays aligned with the business goal.
2. Gather qualitative data: agent logs, crons triggered, bottlenecks still needing manual input.
3. Experiment with a pilot offer or knowledge product (e.g., “Mission Control Starter Pack”).
4. Keep the plan updated as crons evolve and agents respond.
