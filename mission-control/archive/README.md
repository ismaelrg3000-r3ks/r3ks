# Mission Control Archive

This folder stores retired mission docs that supported the initial product/skill strategy research. We only keep them here so the historical context lives in one place without cluttering the active mission surfaces.

## Archived files (2026-02-24)
- `business-plan-2026-02.md` → Replaced by the canonical product vision in `mission-control/product-vision.md`. Keep here as a reference for early go-to-market framing.
- `market-insights-2025.md` → Historical market scan; the few actionable takeaways were folded into `mission-control/intelligence-brief.md`. Archive keeps the original notes without creating noise.
- `skill-learning-plan-2026-02.md` → Long-form research plan now summarized through `mission-control/skills/` notes and `mission-control/intelligence-brief.md`. Archived to reduce new-file creation.
- `agent-skills-report-2026-02.md` → Insights merged into `mission-control/intelligence-brief.md` and reused for skill catalog work. Moved to archive to avoid duplicate drafts.
- `post-mortem-kanban-2026-02.md` → Lessons captured via the `mission-control/15min-log.md` entries and will inform the deliverables checklist; this archive copy keeps the historical artifact if we need to reference it again.

Refer back here when you need the original wording, but use the active docs (product vision, intelligence brief, 15min log, backlog, deliverables checklist) for current planning and reporting.
