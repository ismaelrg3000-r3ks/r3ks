# Mission Control Skills Reading List

This doc captures curated articles, docs, and tutorials for each agent so they can deepen their skillset (systems design, UX, communication, automation). Hint leads the research, summarizes each resource, and notes how the insight will be absorbed (e.g., inspires a new SKILL.md entry, tweaks a workflow, updates a persona) in a short action sentence. Update weekly or whenever a new resource helps the Mission Control cockpit.

| Agent | Focus area | Resource | Summary | Action / Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Torv | Systems design, telemetry, reliability | [Moltbook skills fetch instructions + sandboxes](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2026/02/moltbook-for-openclaw-agents/) | Highlights that Moltbook skills fetch instructions, can execute code, and need sandboxed safety (no wallet/system access). Reinforces the need for telemetry, security gating, and ready-made “skills” for interaction. | Draft instrumentation/telemetry skill that logs fetch+exec metadata, include sandbox safety checks in the skill metadata and update Torv’s WORKING.md to note auditing steps. |
| Rams | Customer experience, UX/voice, design systems | [OpenClaw + Moltbook for do-it-yourself agents](https://theconversation.com/openclaw-and-moltbook-why-a-diy-ai-agent-and-social-media-for-bots-feel-so-new-but-really-arent-274744) | Describes how agents already use skills for document manipulation, scheduling, market monitoring—great UX inspiration for packaging these workflows in Mission Control. | Sketch a UX map (Kanban + live feed + skills) showing how each skill surfaces status; update `mission-control/deliverables-checklist.md` with skill-specific narrative cues. |
| Kami | Communication, storytelling, CEO messaging | [OpenClaw and Moltbook trend summary](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/clawdbot-ai-agent-testing-limits-vertical-integration) | The article paints Moltbook as a social space where agent posts range from work summaries to manifestos—usable for crafting friendly updates with tone/snippets that resonate on social feeds. | Build a “social update template” skill for Kami so she can draft concise weekly posts for you; drop the template into `mission-control/skills/communication.md`. |
| Hint | Research methodology, automation patterns | [Moltbook skill toolkit](https://playbooks.com/skills/openclaw/skills/moltbook) | Official skill page: allows posting, commenting, submolt management, etc. Useful for understanding how to orchestrate agents inside the Moltbook forum. | Create a `mission-control/skills/moltbook-poster` SKILL.md that automates digest creation + posting, referencing the article as evidence for required triggers. |
| r3ks | Strategic narrative & intelligence | [OpenClaw, Moltbook and the future of AI agents](https://www.ibm.com/think/news/clawdbot-ai-agent-testing-limits-vertical-integration) | Frames Moltbook/OpenClaw as a personal, meme-friendly assistant with persistent memory and social reach, showing how agents blend practical tooling + culture. | Note the trend in `mission-control/intelligence-brief.md` and use it to contextualize new social/communications priorities in Kanban briefs. |
| Torv | Skill integration & infrastructure hygiene | [moltbook skill by openclaw/skills — Playbooks](https://playbooks.com/skills/openclaw/skills/moltbook) | Skill metadata highlights registration, API endpoints, and social primitives (posts/comments/upvotes) plus install commands, suggesting how to wire our agent feed connectors. | Prototype a lightweight “Moltbook mirror” skill that fetches community posts and logs them for Mission Control; document the install/registration steps in `mission-control/skills/skill-install-guide.md`. |

Use this table to document the resource (link, title), a short summary, and the concrete action (which skill or tool it feeds). After capturing the new entry, note the corresponding 15-minute beat in `mission-control/15min-log.md` so the team knows the exposure already happened.
