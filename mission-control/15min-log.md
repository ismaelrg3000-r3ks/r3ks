# Mission Control 15-Minute Loop Log

Use this append-only log to record time-stamped notes for every 15-minute cycle. Format: `HH:MM UTC | Owner | Task/Update | Blockers/Next Steps`

[... previous content same ...]
16:30 UTC | r3ks | No replies yet; micro-task now is to identify a fallback telemetry plan (heartbeat + cron metrics we already track) so we can ship a minimal dashboard even if the telemetry ideas arrive late. | No blockers; next step is to note the fallback metrics and update the spec/Convex task accordingly.
16:45 UTC | r3ks | Checked in on the humanized tone + dashboard effort; updated Convex with the fallback metrics, reminded Hint/Torv again, and noted the heartbeat/cron coverage so the next beat has a built-in sync. | No blockers; next step is to log any new signals before the next cycle.
10:05 UTC | hint | Started compiling the Mission Control skills reading list (linking articles/docs to each agent’s focus in `mission-control/skills-reading.md`) and flagged today’s beat under the `skills` label; next step is to source systems-design + communication pieces and log takeaways.
