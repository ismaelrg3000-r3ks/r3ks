Use this append-only log to record time-stamped notes for every 15-minute cycle. Format: `HH:MM UTC | Owner | Task/Update | Blockers/Next Steps`

[... previous content same ...]
16:30 UTC | r3ks | No replies yet; micro-task now is to identify a fallback telemetry plan (heartbeat + cron metrics we already track) so we can ship a minimal dashboard even if the telemetry ideas arrive late. | No blockers; next step is to note the fallback metrics and update the spec/Convex task accordingly.
16:45 UTC | r3ks | Checked in on the humanized tone + dashboard effort; updated Convex with the fallback metrics, reminded Hint/Torv again, and noted the heartbeat/cron coverage so the next beat has a built-in sync. | No blockers; next step is to log any new signals before the next cycle.
10:05 UTC | hint | Started compiling the Mission Control skills reading list (linking articles/docs to each agent’s focus in `mission-control/skills-reading.md`) and flagged today’s beat under the `skills` label; next step is to source systems-design + communication pieces and log takeaways.
14:45 UTC | r3ks | Bootstrapped Tycoon docs/menu; created BUSINESS_MODEL/MISSION_CONTROL/R3KS_ROLE, templates, status data, and mission files for tycoon-mvp plus review request. | Blockers: finalize Discord channel layout and embed-ready dashboard summary.15:10 UTC | r3ks | Holding Tycoon mission documents inside missions/tycoon-mvp/, refreshing status/dashboard-data.md, and prepping TORV/RAMS/R3KS templates while we wait for Meridian’s Discord blueprint signal. | Blockers: Discord blueprint still pending, so no external posts yet.15:30 UTC | r3ks | Cloned abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control, reviewed README for deployment paths/auth, and logged competitor insights in missions/tycoon-mvp/competitor-insights.md. | Blockers: still waiting on Meridian’s Discord blueprint, strategizing how Tycoon narrative outshines polished dashboards.15:55 UTC | r3ks | Reviewed abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control, created setup guide, approvals flow, and refreshed status/dashboard data with gateway/approval fields; logged new mission-control analysis + approval log entries. | Blockers: still waiting on Meridian’s Discord blueprint.16:15 UTC | r3ks | Cloned/inspected crshdn/mission-control, clawdeck, and Danm72/mission-control; documented their unique pivots in competitor-portfolio.md to fuel the SWOT. | Blockers: continuing to monitor new launches, waiting on Meridian’s Discord blueprint.16:45 UTC | r3ks | Attempted to run openclaw-mission-control installer (docker mode + local mode) but keep hitting 'no space left' and uv/compose errors because root is fully occupied. | Blockers: disk capacity prevents building the new mission-control stack.
