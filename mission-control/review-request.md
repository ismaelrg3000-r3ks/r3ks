# Mission Control Team Review & Ideation Request

## Context
We’re currently running the 15-minute cadence centered on the Kanban board prototype, live feed narrative, progress bar logic, and launch guide copy. Every change must be ideated and validated by the specialist squad (Hint, Torv, Rams, Kami) before it goes live. Use the approved surfaces (`WORKING.md`, Convex tables `agents/tasks/activities/messages/notifications`, and the new 15-minute log) to collaborate and triangulate decisions.

## What needs collaborative attention today
1. **Kanban board mapping (Torv)** – Share the latest prototype from the Convex `tasks` table, explain the column logic, and seek feedback on whether it matches the deliverables checklist. Hint and Rams should review the board, suggest missing tasks or status semantics, and log their feedback to `activities`.
2. **Live feed narrative + progress bar (Rams)** – Draft the copy explaining how the Kanban + heartbeats feed the dashboard. Kami and Torv should contribute metaphors, clarify the signals, and confirm the progress bar ties to real deliverables. Record the consensus in `messages` or `notifications` for live visibility.
3. **Launch guide copy (Kami)** – Present the current draft in `/memory/working/kami-<timestamp>.md`, invite Hint/Torv/Rams to brainstorm on the narrative flow, and test the messaging against our market insights. Capture their suggestions via `activities` before finalizing the section.
4. **Gap hunting + insights (Hint)** – Identify missing metrics or gaps (e.g., unassigned tasks, stale intervals) and propose hypotheses or experiments. Torv and Rams should challenge those hypotheses, validate with data, update `tasks`, and log outcomes in the 15-minute log.

## Process reminder
- Before any deliverable is marked “ready,” ensure at least two other agents reviewed it (can be notes, code, or Convex rows). Capture the reviewers’ comments in `activities` or `notifications` so the live feed can highlight the collaborative process. Use the 15-minute log to timestamp these reviews.
- If disagreements arise, document the trade-offs in `mission-control/15min-log.md`, then resolve them through a quick sync (message or short note) before iterating again.
- Once a collaborative decision is confirmed, the delivery can be logged as complete, and the progress bar/progress checklist can move forward.

Let me know if you’d like a short stand-up note after the first review cycle so I can summarize what each agent learned.
