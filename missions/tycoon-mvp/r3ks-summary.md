Title: Mission Control — Momentum Sprint Status
Fields:
- **Agent Health:** r3ks coordinating docs; hint awaiting context; torv paused for automation; rams planning convextable views; kami ready for narrative cards.
- **Current Mission:** tycoon-mvp (Phase 1 Momentum Sprint)
- **Progress:** vision/mission docs authored, TORV/RAMS/R3KS templates populated, status/dashboard data structures refreshed, 15-minute loop beat recorded.
- **Blockers:** waiting on Meridian’s Discord channel blueprint/slash command spec; keeping artifacts inside missions/tycoon-mvp/ until the “Discord blueprint ready” signal arrives.
- **Next Actions:** maintain missions/tycoon-mvp updates, keep using the TORV/RAMS/R3KS templates, and hold dashboard posts until Discord rollout is authorized.
