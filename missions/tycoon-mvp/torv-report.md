TORV REPORT
Date: 2026-02-23
Findings: Tycoon Mission Control startup artifacts (vision, doctrine, R3KS role, templates, mission brief/playbook/dashboard summary) are live and encoded for the Momentum Sprint. Agent health/status data structures are wired for the command board, and we intentionally keep updates within missions/tycoon-mvp/ until Meridian’s Discord blueprint lands.
Severity: low
Recommended Action: Continue logging the 15-minute loop, refresh the dashboard data after each sprint, and hold off on Discord embeds until we hear “Discord blueprint ready.”
