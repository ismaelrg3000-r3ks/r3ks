# Tycoon MVP Dashboard Summary

## Command Board Status (Notion/Discord Embed)
- **Status:** Phase 1 — Momentum Sprint
- **Active Agents:** r3ks (running mission control), hint (ready for research), torv (execution stand-by), rams (data monitoring), kami (storycraft awaiting material)
- **Agent Health:** Refer to `status/agent-health.md` for cadence-ready statuses.
- **Blockers:** 1) Discord channel layout/slash command spec is still being drafted. 2) Summaries/reports are intentionally staying inside `missions/tycoon-mvp/` until Meridian’s Discord blueprint arrives.
- **Next Actions:** Continue refreshing `status/dashboard-data.md`, keep the TORV/RAMS/R3KS templates active for every deliverable, and wait for the explicit “Discord blueprint ready” signal before posting into the new channels.

## Rapport Narrative
- **Momentum Sprint:** Every 15-minute loop feeds `mission-control/15min-log.md`; right now the sprint is about documenting mission artifacts, status signals, and review-ready templates.
- **Mission Control:** `MISSION_CONTROL.md`, `BUSINESS_MODEL.md`, and `R3KS_ROLE.md` codify the command cockpit and the roles each agent plays, ensuring we stay aligned while Meridian prepares the channel layout.
- **Tycoon Command Board:** Dashboard data (see `status/dashboard-data.md`) now references blockers and next actions that reference this hold pattern so Meridian can shape the eventual Notion/Discord cards without guessing what’s ahead.
