# Tycoon MVP Brief

## Vision
Launch Tycoon Mission Control Agency by building a lightweight, repeatable mission cockpit that turns autopilot coordination into passive-income deliverables. The MVP centers on Momentum Sprint beats, Mission Control governance, and the Tycoon Command Board story so we can prove the business model before productizing.

## KPIs
- Dashboard readiness: Tycoon Command Board summary + status files live in `missions/tycoon-mvp/` and `status/`
- Review cadence: TORV → RAMS → R3KS flow documented in `missions/tycoon-mvp/review-request.md`
- Discord migration plan: channel layout and slash command list drafted for the consultant bridge
- Agent health: r3ks, hint, torv, rams, kami have clear next actions and are coordinated via 15-minute logs

## Client Persona
