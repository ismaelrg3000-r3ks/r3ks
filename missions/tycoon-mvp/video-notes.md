# OpenClaw Mission Control Video Notes

- The update introduces a mission control command center (Kanban-style dashboard, live feeds, approvals, skills marketplace) that centralizes multi-agent operations, mirroring Tycoon Command Board goals.
- You can install the official GitHub project (Docker/manual) or build a custom dashboard via OpenClaw/Claw Code; both approaches reinforce the “Describe it, the AI builds it” mentality.
- The pitch emphasizes clarity, governance, and ease: single-pane agent health, human-in-loop approvals, distributed gateway control, and API-first integration.
- Suggested dashboards include backlog/in-progress/review/done boards, client pipelines, content hubs, automation/health trackers, and daily priority queues—precisely the UX/CX targets for Tycoon.
- Iterative build path: start with a basic 30-minute MVP, then expand over a 30-day plan (week-by-week focus: foundation, automations, personalization, full automation + briefs). This matches our Momentum Sprint narrative.
- Additional ideas: mix cheap/free models per sub-task, add repurposing content trackers, automation health, accountability boards, and plug in coaching/community assets for credibility.
- Cautions: setup can be tricky (especially Windows), vet GitHub projects before installing, and be mindful of gateway updates potentially breaking things.
- Community tie-in: AI Profit Boardroom offers playbooks, accountability, daily prompts, and coaching—this could be a future add-on for Tycoon clients needing templates and accountability.
