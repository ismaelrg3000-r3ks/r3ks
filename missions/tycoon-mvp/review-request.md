# Tycoon MVP Review Request

## Overview
Requesting the TORV/RAMS/R3KS review flow for the new Tycoon Mission Control artifacts. This covers the business model, mission control doctrine, R3KS role definition, templates, status data, and mission files created for tycoon-mvp.

## Deliverables
1. `BUSINESS_MODEL.md` — Tycoon Mission Control business plan with vision, product pillars, phases, and KPIs.
2. `MISSION_CONTROL.md` — Doctrine covering cadence, rituals, dashboards, and the command center narrative.
3. `R3KS_ROLE.md` — Role definition for the orchestrator including decision rights and responsibilities.
4. `templates/` — TORV/RAMS/dashboard embed templates for consistent reporting.
5. `status/` — Agent health and dashboard data structures for the Tycoon command board.
6. `missions/tycoon-mvp/*` — Brief, playbook, dashboard summary, and review request capturing Phase 1 deliverables.

## Review Flow
1. **TORV REPORT:** Fill in `templates/torv-report.md` with current findings (vision, deliverables shipped, severity).
2. **RAMS REVIEW:** Use `templates/rams-strategic-review.md` to capture objective drift, tensions, and recommendations for the Tycoon mission after initial sprint.
3. **R3KS SUMMARY:** Provide the `templates/dashboard-embed.md` summary in the command board, highlight any outstanding blockers, agent health, and next actions.

## Request
Please confirm the new mission files/documents are ready to narrate to Ismael and to feed into the dashboard/Discord pipeline. If additional context is needed (e.g., finer KPIs, Cron scripts, Convex tables), note the blockers so they can be addressed before the next sprint.
