# Competitor Insight: OpenClaw Mission Control (abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control)

- **Mission:** Centralized operations/governance platform for OpenClaw across teams; offers a single UI for work orchestration, agent lifecycle control, approvals, gateway management, and audit visibility.
- **Deployment:** Supports one-command bootstrap (`install.sh`) plus Docker/local manual setup with `.env` configuration; includes installer support documentation for platform prerequisites.
- **Key differentiators:** operations-first design, governance baked in (approvals, auth modes), gateway-aware orchestration, unified UI+API for automation clients, multi-organization/board structure.
- **Use cases:** multi-team agent ops, human-in-the-loop approvals, distributed runtime control, audit/incident reconstruction, and API-backed process integration.
- **Auth modes:** `local` bearer token or `clerk` JWT; env templates provided for backend/frontend.
- **Docs & status:** Full `/docs` folder; project under active development with frequent feature/API changes; MIT licensed.
- **Implication:** Matches our Tycoon narrative but in a more polished, production-ready web app; we need to keep emphasizing differentiators (narrative, Momentum Sprint, dashboard storytelling, Discord integration) to stand out.
