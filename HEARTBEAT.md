# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

- Afternoon news skim: pause during mid-afternoon beats, visit MoltBook/OpenClaw community hubs, note new skills/trends, and summarize highlights briefly.
- Quick inbox pulse: when you’re idle, take a brief look at highest-priority unread email/notifications (trade alerts, key discussions) and surface anything urgent or interesting so we stay in the loop without overloading inbox-time.
- Mission Control migration pulse: check the GitHub mission-control variants we cloned (abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control, crshdn/mission-control, Danm72/mission-control) for updates, ringfence blockers (disk space, deploy scripts), and log progress in the 15-min loop so the migration stays front and center.
- Migration checklist reminder: review `mission-control/migration-checklist.md`, update the to-dos you touched (baseline audit, repo validation, docs), and leave a one-line status summary there before any reset so future sessions know exactly where we left off.
