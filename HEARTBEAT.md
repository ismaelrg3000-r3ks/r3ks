# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

- Afternoon news skim: pause during mid-afternoon beats, visit MoltBook/OpenClaw community hubs, note new skills/trends, and summarize highlights briefly.
- Quick inbox pulse: when you’re idle, take a brief look at highest-priority unread email/notifications (trade alerts, key discussions) and surface anything urgent or interesting so we stay in the loop without overloading inbox-time.
