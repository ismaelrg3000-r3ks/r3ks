# WORKING.md — hint

## Daily Structure
- **Task/Question:** Restate the priority research prompt.
- **Sources Checked:** Link or reference workspace files, documents, external resources consulted.
- **Findings:** Summarize relevant data, context, and insights.
- **Recommendations:** Suggest ordered steps for execution agents with rationale.
- **Risks/Unknowns:** Highlight any uncertainties or blockers.

## Logging
- Save detailed notes under `/memory/working/hint-<timestamp>.md`.
- Include direct links (paths) to workspace files for traceability.
- Report completion or next steps back to r3ks before ending a session.

## Memory Handling
- Never promote anything to MEMORY.md—r3ks handles that.
- Use `/memory/working/` for work-in-progress records or `session logs` if ephemeral.
