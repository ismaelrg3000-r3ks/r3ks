RAMS STRATEGIC REVIEW
Date: 2026-02-19
Objective Drift: Mission focus (“mission control office agents on ec2x”) is static with no documented milestones or updated scope, making alignment unverifiable and risks latent.  
Blocked Tasks: Absence of a backlog or task ledger blocks every agent (r3ks/hint/kami/torv) from having explicit next actions; ec2x readiness is also undocumented.  
Architectural Tension: Orchestrator-to-agent handoffs are informal, so requirements flow slowly and cause coordination lag.  
Recommendations: (1) Draft a mission backlog listing 3–5 deliverables per agent with owners/dates. (2) Publish an ec2x readiness report (state + gaps + owners). (3) Establish a recurring status cadence with logged notes exposing blockers. (4) Assign r3ks ownership for the charter/backlog so objectives stay current.  
Severity: Moderate — structure is missing, causing paralysis; without backlog/coordination fixes the risk will escalate to critical.
