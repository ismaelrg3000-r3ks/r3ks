TORV REPORT
Date: 2026-02-21T09:55:00Z
Findings: Built the Convex Kanban board query (`getKanbanBoard`), the gap-notification mutation, and the gap-monitoring script; captured the column map + heuristics in `mission-control/kanban-board.md` and updated the deliverables checklist/log to show progress.
Severity: low
Recommended Action: Wire `getKanbanBoard` into the dashboard view, schedule `scripts/kanban-gap-monitor.js` on Torv’s cron so gaps drive notifications, and keep the board doc in sync with any future column changes.
