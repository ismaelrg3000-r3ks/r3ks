## Sentinel Report — Workspace Audit (2026-02-19 08:31 UTC)

### Missing Infrastructure
1. Report template undefined — `SOUL.md` promises a template but none exists in the workspace.  
2. Memory logs absent — AGENTS.md requires `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files but the directory isn’t present.  
3. Task tracker absent — neither `WORKING.md` nor `/memory/working/` files exist.  
4. USER profile empty — `USER.md` still contains only placeholders.  
5. HEARTBEAT checklist unused — `HEARTBEAT.md` has no entries, so automation currently has no checks defined.

### Untracked Tasks
- Stand up `memory/` and begin daily logs.  
- Create `WORKING.md` or equivalent to log active tasks and owners.  
- Capture user persona in `USER.md`.  
- Define and document the reporting template referenced in `SOUL.md`.

### Authority Issues
- None; gaps stem from missing artifacts, not violations, but missing files could lead to drift.

### Immediate Fixes
1. Document the report template so `SOUL.md` compliance is possible.  
2. Initialize `memory/` logs (daily entries) to restore continuity.  
3. Create a `WORKING.md` ledger for tasks/owners/status.  
4. Populate `USER.md` with real details.  
5. Optionally add heartbeat checks once infrastructure exists.
