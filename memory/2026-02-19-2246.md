- **Session boundary policy**: Rooted the OpenClaw best-practice that each agent must own its own workspace/agentDir/sessions dir. Documented the multi-agent routing guidance and the Fleet Setup page (Multi-Agent Architecture) that forbids reusing session files across agents. Confirmed our config already gives each agent a separate sessions directory, then enforced zero cross-agent reuse by wrapping `resolvePathWithinSessionsDir` and rebuilding the path when `/agents` switches occur.
- **Fix applied**: The `resolveSessionFilePath` helpers in `paths-*` files now swallow invalid foreign paths and fall back to `resolveSessionTranscriptPathInDir`, so switches drop old `sessionFile`s and create a new transcript path scoped to the target agent's `~/.openclaw/agents/<agent>/sessions`. This steel-mans the ownership boundary and aligns with the documented best practices.
