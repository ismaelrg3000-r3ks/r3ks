Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
- **2026-02-18 21:53 UTC**: Investigating agent visibility mismatches between UI and workspace. Created canonical agent SOUL/WORKING files, documented Mission Control doctrine, and adjusted local OpenClaw agent directories (capitalized sessions only) to align with UI.
- **KEY ACTIONS**: Added rams agent workspace manually, disabled lowercase duplicates, seeded advisory logs, and scheduled Mission Control cron reminders. Planning to verify OpenClaw UI auto-load behavior for MEMORY.md/BOOTSTRAP.md and confirm Convex agent records.
- **2026-02-19 08:30 UTC**: Created missing agent infrastructure (memory directories, task logs, user profile) and drafted automation. Initiated sequential agent runs per policy, capturing research/report outputs. Gateway restart is pending/confirmed and rams is being re-registered.
