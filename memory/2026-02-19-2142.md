- **Vision + direction**: Ismael wants a clear goal hierarchy (short-term backlog triage targets and long-term CEO/CTO themes) plus tracking so every decision ties back to higher-level objectives. We expanded the automation loop (goalProgress table, visionGoals, artifacts) to feed a weekly/cron "vision report" and give them both tactical and visionary visibility.
- **Automation loop**: The mission-control triage script now runs every 3 hours with Convex envs, logs handoffArtifacts, routes tasks/docs/knowledge, and writes goalProgress snapshots (counts for tasks/content/knowledge/backlog). Torv, Rams, and Hint each rerun every 2-3 hours with prompts that respond to the previous agent's artifact, keeping the baton handoff alive.
- **Sessions & Agents**: Explained how Telegram threads spawn copies of the main soul (r3ks) rather than new agents; distinct hints/torv/rams/kami sessions carry their own SOULs. We can map thread IDs to conversation labels or prune old transcripts and can disable per-thread session creation from the Telegram integration settings.
- **Next steps**: Keep the automation/crons humming, keep monitoring OpenClaw/AI news (TechCrunch, Reddit, X) for mission-relevant updates, and deliver weekly "vision scorecards" summarizing goalProgress + automation health.
