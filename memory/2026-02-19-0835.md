- **Tasks:** Created missing memory/task infrastructure, updated USER info, defined reporting templates, and captured heartbeat context prior to gateway restart.
- **Agent orchestration:** Sequentially ran hint (research), torv (workspace audit), kami (income narrative), and rams (strategic review) to ensure each agent executed once for the squad. Summary logs stored under `memory/working/` and `memory/advisory/`.
- **Observations:** Logs/agent-monitor directories are now ignored via `.gitignore`. Rams’s workspace identity now reflects `rams`. All actions are committed/pushed so the mission context survives resets.
