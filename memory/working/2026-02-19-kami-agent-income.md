# Mission Control Content Brief — 2026-02-19

## Narrative
1. ROI math microsite and comparison storytelling (before/after video highlight). 2. 45–60s video case shows human vs agent outcomes for C-suite. 3. Interactive ROI calculator (web or sheet) linking cost inputs to projected gains. 4. Field Notes newsletter capturing deployments, metrics, and upcoming automation gaps. 5. Live Ops simulcast/webinar narrating a run with Mission Control commentary. 6. Playset cards showing each agent’s mission, triggers, outputs, and pricing levers.

## Gap Assessment
- Acquisition: No industry-specific KPI benchmarks in demos—publish sectors + KPI baselines.  
- Conversion: Pricing ladder lacks standardization—create Starter/Scale/Enterprise tiers tied to SLAs and governance.  
- Fulfillment: Ops/finance stories thin—produce multi-domain case studies to expand TAM.  
- Lifecycle: Experimentation lacking retention data—pilot anchor clients and share 90-day retention lift study.

## Action Checklist
1. Tag agents by funnel layer, industry, and KPIs.  
2. Build two hero income plays (Lead Reactor, Deal Desk) with full-funnel content bundles.  
3. Capture baseline metrics (time saved, revenue impact) on three flagship clients.  
4. Launch quarterly “Mission Control Ops Review” livestream with pipeline stats.  
5. Publish a public scoreboard showing active agents, revenue per agent, backlog demand.

Style/Tone: strategic + structured; add client logos once approved; assign owners before publishing.
