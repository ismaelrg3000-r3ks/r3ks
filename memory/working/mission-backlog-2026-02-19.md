# Mission Control Backlog Summary — 2026-02-19

- Captured backlog derived from hint’s research output: deliverables for rams (signal catalog, persona pack, runbook), torv (dashboard prototype, heartbeat policy, priority lanes), kami (integration inventory, drift tooling spec, health checklist), and r3ks (orchestrator guide, tooling roadmap, review cadence).
- Logged dependencies (signal/config access, telemetry data, historical runtime) and missing tooling (new connectors, visibility dashboard, drift detection).
- Tasks have been added to `tasks/mission-control-backlog.md` with status tags and cross-agent dependencies; this is the canonical plan for the squad.
