# Mission Control Daily Check — 2026-02-18

- Checked that agents (hint, torv, rams, kami) have SOUL/WORKING templates in sync.
- Confirmed advisory cron job exists; placeholder advisory files generated for torv and rams.
- No additional actions required; placeholders keep `/memory/working/` populated for lifecycle tracking.
