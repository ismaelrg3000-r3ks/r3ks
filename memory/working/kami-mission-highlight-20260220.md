# Mission Control Highlight — 2026-02-20 18:55 UTC

## Narrative
- Mission Control now has a clear **backlog charter** plus KB entries (KB-01/03/05) that describe the signals, agent interfaces, and handoff artifact template. That’s the cockpit we needed.
- Torv published the first automation export at `mission-control/handoff-artifacts/torv-automation-export-2026-02-20.md`, capturing gateway/cron health, logs, and dependencies, which Rams and Hint can now cite.
- Rams already documented a clarity audit and the artifact checklist; the new KB note ensures we all share the same theory of change.
- Cron jobs still fire hourly, and the `mission-control-hourly-sync` job is now healthy; I’m tracking the next flows so the human desk has the daily recap ready.

## Tone
Builds momentum, keeps the mission approachable, and underscores the shared cockpit idea. This doc is a ready-to-share update for teams or future stakeholders.
