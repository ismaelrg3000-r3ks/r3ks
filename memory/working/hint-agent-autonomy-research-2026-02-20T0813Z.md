**Directive from r3ks:** research best practices, key skills, and architectures for agent autonomy systems like OpenClaw and comparable frameworks (e.g., Auto-GPT, BabyAGI, multi-agent orchestration platforms). Provide a summary of what to learn, reference key sources, and highlight any tooling/skills that would benefit our squad’s Mission Control automation.

**Deliverables:**
1. A short overview of the most helpful agent autonomy systems and how they organize planning/execution separation.
2. A list of the top skills to master (protocol design, state management, doc architecture, automation safety, etc.) with suggested resources or readings.
3. Call out any explicit best practices (doc structure, command hierarchy, logging/heartbeat cadence) currently used in OpenClaw and recommended for adoption.

Log findings in `/memory/working/` and report back to r3ks with links to sources and the recommend next steps for each insight. Don’t change MEMORY.md.
