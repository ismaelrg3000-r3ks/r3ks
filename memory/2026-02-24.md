# Daily Summary — 2026-02-24
- Mission Control now has a documented product vision (`mission-control/product-vision.md`) that anchors every task to shipping the r3ks bot business. Highlighted the vision across `AGENTS.md`, `WORKING.md`, and `SOUL.md` so reviewers see the north star up front.
- Added `mission-control/documentation-governance.md` to keep doc creation intentional, references the canonical logs, and introduces the forgettable-priorities system (business focus, product vision, memory persistence).
- Instituted a memory workflow: each priority touch will be logged in `mission-control/15min-log.md`, mirrored into the daily memory file, and eventually summarized in `MEMORY.md` so the context survives between sessions.
- Conducted a doc audit, archived the stale business/market/skill/kanban notes under `mission-control/archive/`, updated the intelligence brief, and recorded the action in `mission-control/15min-log.md` so future audits keep the workspace lean.

## Blockers
- Need a routine script or reminder (cron/heartbeat alert) to keep the weekly doc audit habit alive.
