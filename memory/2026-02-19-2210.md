# Session: 2026-02-19 22:10 UTC

- **Telegram hygiene**: Added a cleanup script (`scripts/cleanup-telegram-threads.sh`) to delete idle `:thread:` entries older than 30 minutes, ran it to prune the existing threads, and scheduled it hourly via `crontab` so the UI stays limited to the main session.  (Logs land in `logs/telegram-thread-cleanup.log`.)
- **Convex mission control instrumentation**: Extended the schema/queries (added `getGoalProgress`, `getVisionGoals`) plus a weekly `mission-control-vision-report.js` script. Scheduled the report for Sundays at 10:00 UTC; it now pulls goal progress over the last 7 days and writes a markdown scorecard + log entry. The triage script already records goal progress counts even as it routes handoffs.
- **Backlog & research**: Updated `tasks/mission-control-backlog.md` with new missions for rams, torv, r3ks, and a new hint section covering Convex goal tracking and drift alerts (status tracker note added). Researched Convex resources (best-practices doc, Convex for Claw page, community guidance on indexes) to inform goal-tracking improvements and knowledge docs.
