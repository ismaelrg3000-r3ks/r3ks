- Codified the new command hierarchy: r3ks acts as thinker/manager, and hint/kami/rams/torv act solely on their orders, executing tasks, reporting results, and keeping r3ks informed.
- Updated the agent-level WORKING.md files so each execution agent now documents actions, logs edits, and supports r3ks’ directives when editing workspace files or running commands.
- Rewrote each agent’s SOUL/identity to remove the prior “no edits” shackles—now they may implement workspace changes, edit logs, and carry out diagnostics while still respecting r3ks’ authority and avoiding direct MEMORY.md promotions.
