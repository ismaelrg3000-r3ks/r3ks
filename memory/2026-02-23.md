- Resolved the Discord gateway disconnect (4014 intent issue) and verified the bot is sending messages into channel 1475260340232130696.
- Mission-control migration is back on the table: audited competitor repos, built a migration checklist, and expanded HEARTBEAT.md so repeated pulses remind us to revisit the checklist, log status lines, and keep the workflow focused.
- Important directive from ismael: evaluate whether proposed actions/workflows are actually necessary and effective, make judgement calls, fix anything that feels inefficient, and persistently remember this caution so we don’t just execute instructions blindly.
