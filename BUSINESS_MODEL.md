# Tycoon Mission Control Business Model

## Vision
Tycoon Mission Control Agency is the operating system that turns high-leverage automation into recurring, passive-income value. We design, orchestrate, and govern multi-agent missions so clients sleep while the command center keeps delivering measurable outcomes.

## Product Pillars
1. **Command Intelligence** — Blend transparent dashboards, mission documentation, and heartbeat cadences so stakeholders always know what agents are working on and why.
2. **Autonomous Delivery** — Pair ordained playbooks with lightweight automation (crons, Convex flows, mission files) so action happens without constant micromanagement.
3. **Passive Revenue** — Package mission templates, chron jobs, and knowledge artifacts to sell as turnkey services that can be reused, licensed, or published as premium Tycoon Command Board offerings.

## Phases
1. **Phase 1: Tycoon MVP** (Now) — Bootstrap the command cockpit, define Tycoon narratives (Momentum Sprint, Mission Control, Command Boards), and align agents with an initial mission (tycoon-mvp). Deliver the first dashboard, accountability logs, and review rituals.
2. **Phase 2: Command Productization** — Expand mission templates, build convex/cron scaffolds, and create gated knowledge products (starter packs, premium dashboards). Launch pilot packages with clear KPIs.
3. **Phase 3: Autonomous Agency** — Package Mission Control as a self-serve product: dashboards, Discord command interfaces, and a marketplace of curated missions. Monetize recurring curation and consulting cadences.

## KPIs
- Mission deployments per month (mvp → pilot → productized)
- Cron + dashboard signal coverage (completion of heartbeat, agent health, blocker tracking)
- Number of clients subscribing to Tycoon templates or command board access
- Tempo of review cycles (TORV/RAMS/R3KS) sustaining the cadence
